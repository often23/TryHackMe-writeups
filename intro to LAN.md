# 🔐 [Intro to LAN] - TryHackMe Writeup

## 🧠 Room Overview
In this room, you will learn the basic structure and communication mechanisms of a local area network (LAN).
**What you will learn:**
- LAN components (switches, routers, hosts)
- The difference between MAC addresses and IP addresses
- The role and mechanism of ARP

## 💻 Environment and Tools
- OS: Kali Linux (for learning purposes)
- Tools Used:
- `ipconfig` / `ifconfig`: Check IP addresses
- `arp`: Check MAC addresses
- `ping`: Check communication

## 🚀 Steps
 1. Understanding network configuration
- Diagrams showing the roles of hosts, switches, and routers
- Communication within a LAN is based on MAC addresses

 2. Checking IP and MAC Addresses
- bash
ifconfig
arp -a

## 💬 Impressions
- I learned how IP addresses and MAC addresses are used in LAN environments, and how they can potentially be exploited.
- Understanding the ARP mechanism gave me insight into how network communication works at a low level, which I believe will deepen my future cybersecurity studies.
