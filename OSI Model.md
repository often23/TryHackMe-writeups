## 🔐 [OSI Model] - TryHackMe Writeup

## 🧠 Room Overview
Learn about the seven layers of the OSI reference model and understand the role each layer plays in network communication.
**What you'll learn:**
- The seven layers of OSI (from physical to application)
- Protocols and functions of each layer
- Differences from the TCP/IP model

## 💻 Environment and Tools
- OS: Kali Linux (for learning purposes)
- Tools Used:
- `wireshark`: Packet capture
- `netstat`: Check connection status
- `curl` / `ping`: Check application layer operation

## 🚀 Procedure

### 1. Understanding the layers of the OSI model
- Review the role of each layer with diagrams and explanations
- Example: HTTP is the application layer, TCP is the transport layer

### 2. Observing packets
bash
wireshark

## 💬 Impressions
- By playing the interactive OSI model game, I was able to memorize the order of the seven layers more naturally and intuitively.
- Learning the role of each layer—from physical transmission to application-level protocols—helped me understand how data flows through a network.
- This hands-on experience made abstract concepts like encapsulation and protocol layering much easier to grasp, and I feel more confident in applying this knowledge to future cybersecurity tasks.
