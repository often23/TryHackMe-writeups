üîê [Malware Analysis] - TryHackMe

üß† Room Overview
In this room, you'll learn the basics of malware analysis. Learn the difference between static and dynamic analysis, learn how to use common tools, and experience basic techniques for understanding malware behavior.

Objectives:
- Understand the structure and behavior of malware
- Learn the difference between static analysis (investigating a file without executing it) and dynamic analysis (executing it and observing its behavior)
- Acquire the initial response skills necessary for SOC operations

 üíª Environment and Tools
- TryHackMe AttackBox or Kali Linux
- Tools Used:
- strings: Extraction of human-readable strings from binaries
- VirusTotal: Hash matching and threat intelligence
- CyberChef: Encoding and decoding
- PEStudio: Static analysis of Windows PE files
- CAPA: MITRE ATT&CK-based feature detection

üöÄ Procedure
- File acquisition and hash verification
- Obtain hashes using md5sum or sha256sum and verify them with VirusTotal
- Static analysis
- Check internal strings with strings
- Analyze section structures and API calls with PEStudio
- Dynamic Analysis (Simple)
- Observing Behavior in the Execution Environment (Limited in This Room)
- Functionality Detection Using CAPA
- Mapping Malware Functions (e.g., File Deletion, Network Communication) to MITRE ATT&CK

üèÅ Flags
- User Flag: THM{malware_behavior}
- Root Flag: None (Because Analysis is Focused)

üí¨ Impressions
- Lessons Learned:
- The First Step in Malware Analysis: "Learn Without Executing" Static Analysis
- Tools like CAPA can correlate with MITRE ATT&CK
- A lot of information can be obtained through hash matching and string extraction alone
 
- Awareness and Points for Improvement:
- Familiarizing yourself with strings and CyberChef will be useful in CTF and SOC work.
- Understanding the structure of PE files will directly improve your analysis skills.
